         <p class="post">For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.</p>
         <p class="post">Voila! In view humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the “vox populi” now vacant, vanished.</p>
         <p class="post">Can it be I stayed away too long? Did you miss these sweat rhymes when I was gone? As you listen to this crazy track, check them stats and you know where I'm at. And that's that.</p>
         <p class="post">Gorrilas drag their victims, Hyenas try to sue. Snakes find grass in concrete, there is no city zoo.</p>
         <p class="post">Don't expect me to lie, don't expect me to cry, don't expect me to die for me. Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam. Sunbeams are never made like me. Don't expect me to cry - for all the reasons you had to die. Don't ever ask your love of me.</p>
         <p class="post">I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do. I am the resurrection and I am the life, I couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as I'd like.</p>
